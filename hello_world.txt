After learning here, I am going to establish an active practice of computer 
software development. This is the stat tho, but I will eventually become better
at this. No giving up! Yeah, i said that. *smiles*
While the world seem to be deeming everthing hard, the passion of getting 
our voice heard is a fight that i have started for myself. 
By the way, we are all somebosdy to someone. *smiles* 
We don't always necessarily get to figure it out. That somebody that means a conny smile.
